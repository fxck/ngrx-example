# TODO
- [ ] reconsider folder naming with dots, finder thinks it's an extension
- [ ] add readme
- [ ] add html descriptions to components through whole app, explaining things, and links to their github counterparts
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] fix zone error `it takes like 10 seconds before this triggers https://github.com/fxck/ngrx-example/blob/master/src/app/_people/routes/people.list.route/people.list.route.ts#L62 and there are some Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'unsubscribe' of undefined errors, which I suppose is caused by that ngOnDestroy`
- [ ] add loading indication
- [ ] add success notifications
